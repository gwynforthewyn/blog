I have support now for loading credentials in to jenkins; next seems like adding
support for mounting credentials in from some external location will get me where I need to be.

I should probably add a script to generate the credentials in the right format.

So many chores, so little time ðŸ™‚

I'm writing the credentials generator script, and I'm trying to keep the whole thing in one single file (besides some modules in a virtualenv),
so I'm performing argv parsing shenanigans and I'm trying out doctests and I'm feeling pretty good about life.
