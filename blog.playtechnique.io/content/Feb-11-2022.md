Title: `go mod init` learned me a gopath

There's a small "cannot determine module path" error I saw in `go mod init` and decided to get to the bottom of.

GOPATH looks like it's in flux. https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/#working-with-go says you learn about gopath in https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH which says it's a deprecated page and you should go to https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-GOPATH_environment_variable for example.

[That last link](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-GOPATH_environment_variable) says:


    The Go path is used to resolve import statements. It is implemented by and documented in the go/build package.

The docs also say:

    GOPATH and Modules
    When using modules, GOPATH is no longer used for resolving imports. However, it is still used to store downloaded source code (in GOPATH/pkg/mod) and compiled commands (in GOPATH/bin).


So when using modules, I think it's saying that GOPATH isn't used to resolve imports. But what about when determining the module's name when initialising it?


```bash
; cd $GOPATH/nickypoos/inwisible
; go mod init
go: cannot determine module path for source directory /Users/gwyn/Developer/go/nickypoos/inwisible (outside GOPATH, module path must be specified)

Example usage:
	'go mod init example.com/m' to initialize a v0 or v1 module
	'go mod init example.com/m/v2' to initialize a v2 module

Run 'go help mod init' for more information.
; cd $GOPATH                                                                                                                                                                 
; mkdir src && mv nickypoos src/                                                                                                                                            
; cd src/nickypoos/inwisible                                                                                                                                                
; go mod init
go: creating new go.mod: module nickypoos/inwisible
```

So `go mod init` does interact with GOPATH and expects to find modules within the standard directory layout. Note that the [GOPATH docs for `go mod init`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Initialize_new_module_in_current_directory) mention that there's an interaction:


    Init accepts one optional argument, the module path for the new module. If the module path argument is omitted, init will attempt to infer the module path using import comments in .go files, vendoring tool configuration files (like Gopkg.lock), and the current directory (if in GOPATH).


However, those same docs suggest visiting [the page for `go mod init`](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-init) for further details, and that page repeats the same paragraph.
