Title: First Things First: CLI should be compiled, and I don't know the language

If I'm going to try and build out CI as an operations workflow, I need tooling to make the lift easy.

No company ever would love to hire an ops person who is first all, "I need a month to build a CI server!" So I need to ramp that
down from a month to a half hour.

I already have containerised Jenkins itself, so that's neato and it starts up easily, but it's missing many features. I need to be able to start
Jenkins up, and have it load a pre-defined build job.

That means there are two projects here:

1. Jenkins must be able to start a pre-defined job on startup.
1. It must be fast to write a Jenkins job.

Jenkinsfiles are a pain in the arse for most folks. I've been speculating for a while that removing the boilerplate might help.

This all feels very very "I need a CLI tool", and I suspect I'll get there, but I want to use a compiled language but I don't 
know one super well. Time to learn.

go + cobra seems like the winning formula. Let's get some learning done.
