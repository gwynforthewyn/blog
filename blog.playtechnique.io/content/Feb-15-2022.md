Title: Publishing a Port With the docker go sdk That Won't

The [docker go sdk](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/sdk/) is clearly awesome, but in another also clear way it's challenging to read and understand. We're going to try and rebuild this command, but using the go sdk:

```bash
docker run -d --rm -p 9080:8080 --name jinkies jamandbees/jinkies:latest
```

Note this produces a container that looks like this in `docker ps`:
```bash
; docker ps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                       COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                               NAMES
e6d1b4be197e   jamandbees/jinkies:latest   "/sbin/tini -- /usr/â€¦"   3 seconds ago        Up 3 seconds        50000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9080->8080/tcp   jinkies
```

Note this command (a) starts a container (b) ensures the container is removed after stopping (c) exposes and publishes a port (d) names the container and (e) downloads the named image.

We'll do this in three parts: general go setup code, pull the image, and then starting the container with the right options.

## general go setup code

The [usage instructions](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/docker/docker@v20.10.12+incompatible/client#hdr-Usage) for the SDK tell us we need a [context](https://pkg.go.dev/context) and a client object first:

```go
import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/docker/go-connections/nat"
	"io"
	"os"

	"github.com/docker/docker/api/types"
	"github.com/docker/docker/api/types/container"
	"github.com/docker/docker/client"
) // note all the imports. I won't be repeating them later.

ctx := context.Background()
cli, err := client.NewClientWithOpts(client.FromEnv, client.WithAPIVersionNegotiation())
```

I believe the context is used to track http calls back and forth with the engine, and the client is used to dictate to the engine what functions we would like to call.

## pull the image

* an image:

```go
imageName := "jamandbees/jinkies"

out, err := cli.ImagePull(ctx, imageName, types.ImagePullOptions{})
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

defer out.Close()
io.Copy(os.Stdout, out)
```

## starting the container with the right options
We want these properties satisfied:
* starts a container
* ensures the container is removed after stopping 
* exposes and publishes a port 
* names the container

We'll use `cli.ContainerCreate` for this. Its signature's a bit hairy:

```go
func (cli *Client) ContainerCreate(ctx context.Context, config *container.Config, hostConfig *container.HostConfig, networkingConfig *network.NetworkingConfig, platform *specs.Platform, containerName string) (container.ContainerCreateCreatedBody, error)
```
Just reading the signature, how do we name the container? Looks like the last argument is `containerName`. We're winning already!

I think "ensures the container is removed after stopping" is going to require a call to some other functions. So that's 2 requirements down already!

Just calling this function starts the container. We're incredibly winning here: 3 out of 4 and barely any code written.

So, networking. The networking we want is host -> container, so it's part of the hostConfig parameter.

```go
resp, err := cli.ContainerCreate(ctx, &container.Config{
	Image: imageName,
})
```


, &container.HostConfig{
	PortBindings: nat.PortMap{"8080": {{HostIP: "0.0.0.0", HostPort: "8080"}}},
}, nil, nil, "jinkies")
```
